MoCCA-PMA
=========

The projects I completed for Dr. Adam Porter's Programming Mobile Applications for Android Handheld Systems, given on Coursera, starting in January 2014 and ending in March 2014. This class was the first in the Mobile Cloud Computing on Android Specialization on Coursera.org.

These projects focused on creating applications that worked on an Galaxy Nexus using API 19. In completing the course
with a verified certificate with distinction, I was able to move on in the next course in the series. My grade for the class was 100, and was totaled from completion of the projects, quizzes and the final.
